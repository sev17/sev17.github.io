# SQL Saturday #32

I presented a one hour session at [SQL Saturday #32](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/eventhome.aspx) in Tampa on [Powershell ETL](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=32&sessionid=882): "In this sesssion we will look at performing common data loading tasks with Powershell. A basic understanding of PowerShell is helpful, but not necessary. Specific topics covered include importing structured files, XML, WMI objects and ADO.NET data sources."

SQL Saturday's and Code Camps usually host a Powershell track and Tampa SQL Saturday was no exception. [Aaraon Nelson](http://sqlvariant.com/wordpress/) and [Ron Damron](http://www.simple-talk.com/author/ron-dameron/) also presented complimentary Powershell sessions on [Powershell for Data Professionals](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=32&sessionid=895) and [Database Hardening via Powershell](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=32&sessionid=895) respectively. Between the three of use we had a half day of Powershell on Saturday!

My thanks to everyone in attendence. I hope to see many of you at our first [Tampa Powershell User Group](http://www.tampapowershell.com/) meeting on March 11, 2010. Feel free to post questions and comments. The presentation and supporting materials for the **Powershell ETL** session are available here:
