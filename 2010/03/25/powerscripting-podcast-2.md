# Powerscripting Podcast 2

I was interviewed by Jon ([@JonWaltz](http://twitter.com/jonwalz)) and Hal ([@Halr9000](http://twitter.com/halr9000)) in [episode 106 of the PowerScripting Podcast](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/episode-106-sql-psx-with-chad-miller/). This was my [second time coming on the show](/2008/10/powerscripting-podcast/) and it was great to be back. In the interview we talked about the PowerShell changes in SQL Server 2008 R2--There is none :(. I provide a summary of what's in SQLPSX with a concentration on the version 2 features including [SQLIse](http://sev17.com/2010/03/sqlise-a-powershell-based-sql-server-query-tool/). We also touch on how you work with the various SQL Server components (Database Engine, SSRS, SSIS, Replication, Agent) using PowerShell. And lastly, we went a bit off topic on what I do and where I work. Check out the Podcast and while your at it listen to their otherÂ episodes. These guys do a wonderful job putting together a quality podcast week after week. They focus on bringing in top notch guests including members of the PowerShell product team and PowerShell MVPs. I'm not big podcast subscriber, but I do listen to their show to keep update-to-date on what's happening with PowerShell and pick up some useful tips. Oh, and if you have time [drop in on the live show on Thursdays at 9:30 PM](http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&site=powerscripting.wordpress.com&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ustream.tv%2Fchannel%2Fpowerscripting-podcast). The live show has the feel of a weekly online user group. There is a lively chat session where you can ask questions of the guests and other attendees. I'm usually online too, so stop by and say hi.
