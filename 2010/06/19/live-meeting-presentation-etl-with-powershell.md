# Live Meeting Presentation - ETL with PowerShell

On Tuesday June 22nd 9 PM Eastern I”m presenting [ETL with PowerShell](http://www.sqlpass.org/Events/ctl/ViewEvent/mid/521.aspx?ID=321) for [PASS AppDev VC](http://appdev.sqlpass.org/)—a virtual chapter of [Professional Association for SQL Server (PASS)](http://www.sqlpass.org/). In this presentation we will look at performing common data loading tasks with Powershell. A basic understanding of PowerShell is helpful, but not necessary. Specific topics covered include importing structured files, XML, WMI objects and ADO.NET data sources. This is a subject which forms the foundation of many my production PowerShell scripting solutions. The Live Meeting is open to anyone, mark your calendar or check the recording afterward.
