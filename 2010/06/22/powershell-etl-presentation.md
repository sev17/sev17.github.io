## Comments

**[Tim Bruce](#169 "2010-06-23 14:43:25"):** Hmm...It's prompting me for a login. Even though I didn't attend, is there some way I can get a copy of the presentation? Tim

**[Chad Miller](#170 "2010-06-23 16:13:57"):** The down zip file shouldn't require a login -- let me know if this isn't the case. For the Live Meeting recording, the only thing that's required is a name in the Your Name field and you don't even have to use your real name :)

**[Zach](#171 "2010-06-24 12:30:43"):** I got to catch the bulk of the presentation, had some great ways to utilize PS. Thanks for the great ideas.
