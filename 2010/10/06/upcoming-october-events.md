ETL with PowerShell

Orlando SQL Saturday features a full PowerShell track, in addition to my session;  Max Trinidad ([Blog](http://www.maxtblog.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/maxtrinidad)), Aaron Nelson ([Blog](http://sqlvariant.com/wordpress/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sqlvariant)), Ron Dameron ([Blog](http://ronalddameron.blogspot.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/rondba)) and Ed Wilson aka Scripting Guys ([Blog](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/default.aspx)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/scriptingguys/)) will be presenting PowerShell talks.

I’m really excited about the new [PASS PowerShell VC](http://powershell.sqlpass.org), a virtual chapter of Professional Association of SQL Server ([PASS](http://sqlpass.org/)). Until now there hasn’t been a place for database professional to talk about PowerShell. This may sound surprising, but in order to appeal to a wider community of IT professionals I try not to talk SQL Server much at the [Tampa PowerShell User Group](http://powershellgroup.org/tampa.fl)  The group is made up of IT Pros, DBAs and developers and overly focusing on one area alienates other members. Likewise most SQL Server user groups have an obligation to their members (BI, developers, DBA) to present a wide variety of SQL Server topics and not only PowerShell. Each group must serve all of their members. PASS PowerShell VC represents a place where SQL Server professional can discuss all SQL Server and PowerShell all the time!

[World Wide Online Tech Day](http://www.online.techday.net.br/En/Home/) is an event put on by the Brazilian technical community. They’ve lined up four online PowerShell sessions for Saturday, October 30th.
