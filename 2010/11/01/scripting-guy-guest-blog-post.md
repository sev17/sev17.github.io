# Scripting Guy Guest Blog Post

Ed Wilson ([Blog](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/default.aspx)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/scriptingguys/)) aka Scripting Guy is kicking off a SQL Server week (Nov 1st 2010) with my guest blog post. The post, [Use PowerShell to Collect Server Data and Write to SQL](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2010/11/01/use-powershell-to-collect-server-data-and-write-to-sql.aspx), demonstrates my number one use case for database related PowerShell activities—loading data into a SQL Server table. I’ve used the techniques described in the post to build many solutions including: 

  * A [data dictionary](/2010/08/a-really-simple-data-dictionary/)
  * [Disk and database space forecasting](/2009/10/sqlservercentral-article-on-database-space-capacity-planning/)
  * [Backup reporting](/2009/06/sqlservercentral-article-on-backup-monitoring-and-reporting/)
Each problem comes down to one thing—get the data into a SQL Server database! Learn the basics and you can easily create your own PowerShell-based solutions.
