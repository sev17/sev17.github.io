**[Bill Ross - Pax EDI](#292 "2012-07-24 16:20:04"):** Hey, Chad, I'm stopping by to grad a script. I wanted to thank you for the excellent presentation. You presented, very clearly, some very practical applications for scripting that look will serve my current need. Thanks, and all the best to you.
