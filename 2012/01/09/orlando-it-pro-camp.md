# Orlando IT Pro Camp

The [Orlando IT Pro Camp](http://itprocamp.com/orlando/) marks our third event after Tampa and South Florida. As with the prior IT Pro Camps I’m helping put together the Orlando IT Pro Camp. [Register to attend](http://orlandoitprocamp.eventbrite.com/) this free event on **Saturday, January 21st**. Orlando will be even bigger than Tampa or South Florida with 30 sessions on topics covering Hyper-v, Private Cloud, SharePoint, System Center Products, SQL Server, PowerShell, Active Directory, Windows 2008 R2, and Windows 7 . I’ll be presenting a PowerShell session on [Storing Powershell Output](http://itprocamp.com/orlando/sessions/?session=yyxxk4).  A few sessions I’ve seen previously and highly recommend: 

  * [Intro to SQL Server for IT Professionals](http://itprocamp.com/orlando/sessions/?session=prbvcd) by Michael Wells ([Blog](http://sqltechmike.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/SqlTechMike))—An excellent overview of SQL Server for the system admin SQL noob.
  * [Version Control for IT Professionals](http://itprocamp.com/orlando/sessions/?session=oh126k2) by Jason Hofferle ([Blog](http://www.hofferle.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jhofferle)) – A good overview of using Mercurial source control for sys admin scripts.
  * [Introduction to PowerShell Remoting](http://itprocamp.com/orlando/sessions/?session=oh126k) also by Jason Hofferle ([Blog](http://www.hofferle.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jhofferle))  —An eye opening look at the benefits of using Powershell remoting in a large enterprise based on real-world benchmarks.
If you can’t make Orlando, the Sarasota IT Pro Camp will be held on Saturday, February 18th. 2012. See the [IT Pro Camp site](http://itprocamp.com/) for more information.
