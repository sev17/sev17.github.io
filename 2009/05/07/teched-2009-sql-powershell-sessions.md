# TechEd 2009 SQL + Powershell Sessions

[Bill Ramos](http://blogs.msdn.com/billramo/default.aspx), Principal Program Manager on the SQL Server Management Studio team, will be delivering [several sessions](http://edge.technet.com/Media/TechEd-2009-with-Bill-Ramos/) on two of my favorite topics, SQL Server and Powershell. Specifically Bill will be discussing Policy Based Management (PBM) and an interesting CodePlex project called [Enterprise Policy Management Framework](http://epmframework.codeplex.com/). The project has the stated goal of extending Policy-Based Management to all SQL Server instances in the enterprise and works against SQL 2008 as well as 2005 and 2000 instances. I've been meaning to kick the tires on PBM and Enterprise Policy Management Framework looks like something I should check out. Oh, and a little CodePlex project called [SQL Server Powershell Extensions](http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/) ![Smile](http://shared.live.com/o5ZS870nhiJMYQrZY6kNyQ/emoticons/smile_regular.gif) will be mentioned in [Bill's Powershell presentation](http://blogs.msdn.com/billramo/archive/2009/05/06/sqlpsx-from-chad-miller.aspx). I'm unable to attend TechEd this year, If you're fortunate enough to go and have an interest in SQL and Powershell, checkout Bill's sessions.
