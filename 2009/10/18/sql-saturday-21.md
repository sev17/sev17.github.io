# SQL Saturday #21

I presented a 1 hr session at [SQL Saturday #21](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/eventhome.aspx?eventid=32) session [SQL Server PowerShell Extensions](http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/): In this sesssion we will look at automating common DBA tasks through Powershell. An overview of the CodePlex project SQL Serer Powershell Extensions will be provided. Specific topics covered include [PowerGUI](http://www.powergui.org/), SQL Server security/permissions reporting, SSIS administration, replication and agent tasks, performing ETL with Powershell."

The two part format with [Max Trinidad](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/) worked out very well. There's just too much material cover in one session and get into some advanced stuff. My thanks to everyone in attendence. Feel free to post questions and comments.

The presentation and supporting materials are available [here](http://cid-ea42395138308430.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/SQLSaturday_Orlando_20091017.zip):
