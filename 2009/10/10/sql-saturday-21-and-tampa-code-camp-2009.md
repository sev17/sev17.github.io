# SQL Saturday #21 and Tampa Code Camp 2009

A couple upcoming events I'll be presenting at...

## [SQL Saturday #21 on October 17th in Orlando](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/schedule.aspx?eventid=32)

I'm amazed at how SQL Saturday has grown since the first one just a couple of years ago. Nearly 300 attendees have registered and there's still time to [sign up for this free event](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/register.aspx). There will be over 50 sessions with good mixture of veteran and new speakers. I enjoy listening to polished presentations that have the look and feel of something I would see at one of the large conferences. Just as important I appreciate many of the first time speakers that remind me of one of my team meetings, listening to a fellow peer talk about a subject they feel passionate about.  I will be presenting a two-part session on SQL Server and Powershell with [Max Trinidad](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/).

In the week leading up to SQL Saturday there are several low cost one-day seminars. As many of you know I manage a DBA team, so I'm sending a couple people to the pre-event training.

## [Tampa Code Camp 2009 on November 7th](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/)

[Max](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/) and I are teaming up once again to deliver a two-part PowerShell session on Saturday, November 7th. Because Powershell is among other things a .NET language, Code Camps presents a great venue to host PowerShell sessions. Although my domain SQL Server at Code Camp I'll try to explain PowerShell outside the context of a SQL Server and present use cases for developers. You can register for this free event [here](https://www.clicktoattend.com/register.aspx?eventid=141803).
