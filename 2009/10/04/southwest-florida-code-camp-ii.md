# Southwest Florida Code Camp II

I presented a Powershel session at the [SW Florida .Net Code Camp II](http://codecamp.swfldev.net/). The session demonstrated the following uses cases for developer usage of Powershell:

  * ETL
  * Testing (PSUnit and WatIN)
  * Deployment Automation
  * Management API

The presentation and supporting materials are available [here](http://cid-ea42395138308430.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/SWFL^_CodeCamp^_20091003.zip): [Max Trinidad](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/) presented 3 one-hour sessions, so we were able to basically run a Powershell track at the code camp! It was fun taking part in a one day Powershell event. My thanks to everyone in attendence and to the [SW Florida .NET Developers Group](http://www.swfldev.net/) for all the work that went into hosting code camp. Feel free to post questions and comments.
