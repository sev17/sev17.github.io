# Tampabay SQL Server User Group Presentation

I presented a one-hour session for [Tampabay SQL Server User Group](http://www.tampasql.com/) on Powershell and SQL Server. I've previously delivered this session for the Sarasota and Orlando SQL Server User Groups. The presentation and supporting materials are available here:

My thanks to everyone who attended and all of your great feedback.
