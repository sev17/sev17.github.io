# SQLSaturday #16 South Florida Downloads

I presented a 1 hr session at SQL Saturday #16 session **PowerShell and SQL Server Administration**: _In this sesssion we will look at automating common DBA tasks through Powershell. An overview of the CodePlex project [SQL Serer Powershell Extensions](http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/) will be provided. Specific topics covered include SSIS administration, replication and agent monitoring, performing simple ETL with Powershell and building graphs, charts and diagrams using Powershell_."

The presentation and supporting materialsÂ are available here:

The two part format with [Max Trinidad](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/) worked out well and we were able to cover alot of ground between our back-to-back sessions. My thanks to everyone in attendence. Feel free to post questions and comments.
