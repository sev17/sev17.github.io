# Continuous Integration in a Development Environment using Red Gate Backup and SQL Compare

My co-worker and fellow DBA, [Leigh Freijo](http://leighfreijo.com/) has a [blog entry](http://leighfreijo.com/2009/08/21/continuous-integration-in-a-development-environment-using-red-gate-backup-and-sql-compare/) about a Powershell script he created to re-integrate QA/Development database changes using Red Gate SQL Backup and Red Gate SQL Compare snapshot files. The script providers a wrapper around Red Gate's command line tools. This is a good demonstration of the strength of any scripting language -- The ability to glue together existing tools to make another tool. Nice work Leigh!
