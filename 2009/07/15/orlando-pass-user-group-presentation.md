# Orlando PASS User Group Presentation

I presented a one-hour session for [Orlando PASS User Group](http://www.opass.org/) on Powershell and SQL Server. I had [previously given this talk](/2009/05/sarasota-sql-server-user-group-presentation/) for the Sarasota SQL Server User Group. The presentation and supporting materials are available here:

I'd like to thank [Jack Corbett](http://www.wiseman-wiseguy.blogspot.com/) and [Andy Warren](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/andy_warren/default.aspx) for inviting me to speak and for the wonderful questions/feedback.
