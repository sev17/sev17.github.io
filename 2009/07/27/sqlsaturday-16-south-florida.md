# SQLSaturday #16 South Florida

I'm giving a presentation at [SQLSaturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx) in South Florida on August 8th 2009. If you haven't been to a SQLSaturday, they're free one-day events put on by local [SQLPASS ](http://www.sqlpass.org/)chapters. As an added bonus there will be two PowerShell sessions:

PowerShell MVP and prolific presentor, [Max Trindad](http://max-pit.spaces.live.com/) will be presenting "**PowerShell and SQL Server**: _Learn how DBA's and Developers can take advantage of this new .NET scripting technology - PowerShell 2.0. This is a "most" to learn IT/.NET skill. In this session will discuss the difference between using SMO and the new integrated SQLPS in assisting managing your SQL Server 2000/2005/2008_."

I will present a session on "**PowerShell and SQL Server Administration**: _In this sesssion we will look at automating common DBA tasks through Powershell. An overview of the CodePlex project [SQL Serer Powershell Extensions](http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/) will be provided. Specific topics covered include SSIS administration, replication and agent monitoring, performing simple ETL with Powershell and building graphs, charts and diagrams using Powershell_." If you can attend both sessions we're planning a part 1 and part 2 format. This should be another great community event with plenty of PowerShell content and there's still time to [register](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx).
