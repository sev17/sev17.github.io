# SQLServerCentral Article on Getting Data out of SQL Server from Powershell

Using ADO.NET from Powershell has been covered by several articles, blog entries, and discussion group postings; however alternatives methods have not been as widely written about. The article, [Getting Data out of SQL Server from Powershell](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/powershell/65324/) demonstrates three alternative methods to ADO.NET for querying SQL Server from Powershell. The approaches demonstrated are simplier than ADO.NET and include: 

  1. SMO ExecuteWithResults
  2. SQL Server 2008 Powershell Cmdlet Invoke-SqlCmd
  3. CodePlex SQL Server Powershell Extensions function Get-SqlData
See [the full article](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/powershell/65324/) for details.
