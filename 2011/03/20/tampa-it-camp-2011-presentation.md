# Tampa IT Camp 2011 Presentation

I presented a one hour session at Tampa IT Camp on SQL Server PowerShell Extensions ([SQLPSX](http://sqlpsx.codeplex.com/)): “In this session we will look at how the CodeProject SQLPSX can be used for real world PowerShell automation. Specific topics covered include using ADO.NET, retrieving SQL Server information, SSIS administration, Policy-Based Management and SQLIse a WPF-based query tool.” This is the same presentation I gave at Tampa SQL Saturday #62. The presentation and demo scripts can be found [here](http://cid-ea42395138308430.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/SQLSaturday%5E_Tampa%5E_20110115.zip) My thanks to everyone who attended
