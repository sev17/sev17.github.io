# SQL Saturday #62

I presented a one hour session at [SQL Saturday #62](http://sqlsaturday.com/62/eventhome.aspx) in Tampa on SQL Server PowerShell Extensions (SQLPSX): “In this sesssion we will look at how the CodeProject SQLPSX can be used for real world PowerShell automation. Specific topics covered include using ADO.NET, retrieving SQL Server information, SSIS administration, Policy-Based Management and SQLIse a WPF-based query tool.” The Tampa SQL Saturday featured a full PowerShell track, in addition to my session;  Aaron Nelson ([Blog](http://sqlvariant.com/wordpress/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sqlvariant)), Ron Dameron ([Blog](http://ronalddameron.blogspot.com/)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/rondba)) and Ed Wilson aka Scripting Guys ([Blog](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/default.aspx)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/scriptingguys/)) also presented PowerShell talks.
