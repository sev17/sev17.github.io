# Upcoming Events

If  you live in Central/South Florida or are planning a trip, we’ve got several IT community events worth checking out… 

## May

[SQLRally](http://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/orlando/) in Orlando on May 12th through May 13th. Although SQLRally isn’t a free event, but the pricing is extremely low at only $299 if booked by April 12th.  I really admire [SQL PASS](http://sqlpass.org/) for putting together a low price 2-day event with top notch speakers and sessions. 

## June

The third annual [Tampa SharePoint Saturday](http://www.sharepointsaturday.org/tampa/default.aspx) is on Saturday, June 11th. This is a free one-day event similar to SQL Saturdays and Code Camps. I’ve never been to SharePoint Saturday, so this will be first for me. I’m also planning on presenting a PowerShell session. 

## July

After a successful [Tampa IT Camp](http://itcampsaturday.com/tampa/), I’m helping put together the first annual [South Florida IT Camp](http://itcampsaturday.com/southflorida) on Saturday, July 23rd. This event will be even bigger than Tampa. We’re planning on having an optional low-priced pre-con in addition to the full free one-day IT Camp event. The South Florida IT Camp is being organized by Adnan Cartwright and the [Florida IT Server Group](http://www.fisg.us/). I’m planning on presenting a PowerShell session and I’ll be posting more details about the event.
