# My First Blog Entry

My name is Chadwick (Chad) Miller, I've been a SQL Server DBA since 2000 and I've alway been someone who writes scripts using VBScript, Windows bat files, wmic, Perl, XSLT, T-SQL, GNUWin32 Shell tools, and now PowerShell.  After spending hundreds of hours writing PowerShell scripts for SQL Server resulting in the creation of the CodePlex project SQL Server PowerShell Extensions or [SQLPSX](http://www.codeplex.com/sqlpsx) I decided to start a blog about PowerShell scripting SQL Server. This is my first blog entry.
