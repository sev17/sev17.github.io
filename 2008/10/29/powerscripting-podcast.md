# PowerScripting Podcast

I did an interview,  [Episode 46 - SQL PSX](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/episode-46-sql-psx/). at the [PowerScripting Podcast](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/) show discussing:

  * Powershell adoption and deployment at my company
  * My day-to-day usage Powershell
  * My thoughts on the SQL Server 2008 Powershell host (see this [blog post ](/2008/10/microsoft-sqlps-review/)for a more detailed review)
  * And of course the Codeplex project [SQL Server Powershell Extensions (SQLPSX)](http://www.codeplex.com/SQLPSX)
Somehow I forgot to mention my second Codeplex project [PoshRSS](http://www.codeplex.com/PoshRSS). Thanks Hal and Jon for a great experience, you did a wonderful job hosting and editing the show.
